This repository demonstrates an inconsistency in the `removeIf` function's behavior across different Kotlin collection types. The `removeIf` function is designed to remove elements from a collection that satisfy a given predicate. However, its behavior varies unexpectedly across `List`, `Set`, and `Map` data structures. The `removeIfBug.kt` file contains code that illustrates this unexpected behavior, and the `removeIfSolution.kt` file presents the solution. The solution explains the underlying reasons and provides recommendations for consistent usage across different collection types.
